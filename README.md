# Movie clustering

This repository is a collection of scripts that can cluster movies according to the users how saw them.

## Data source
The source of the data is an online service accessible via https://everyfad.com/movies or the Android app [MoviesFad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fema.moviesfad).

In order to run code in this project, you need to have access to this database and to some libraries that facilitate the reading of the data. 
At the moment, those resources are not public. 

For this project, I considered the 20000 most active users of the service and the 10000 most watched movies. The data was taken in April 2020.

The data is about how many times each of those users watched each of those movies.

## Clustering methods
This project aims to show the differences between spectral clustering and dominant sets for clustering movies.

## Data representation
The most natural embedding of movies in this context is to use the N dimensionality space, with N=20000, in which each dimension is a different user. The value of each dimension is proportional to the logarithm of how many times a user watched a particular movie.  
Using the logarithm allows to reduce the effect of noise and glitches: for example the data imported from a particular external service contained a lot of repetition, so for example it may appear that an user watched the same movie dozens of times.

For this project, I choose to use a pairwise clustering approach, i.e. clustering movies according to their pairwise similarities instead of directly using this high dimensionality representation. 
 
This similarity is the result of the Gaussian kernel applied to the cosine distances between movies. 

### Preliminary considerations

Since the data comes from real viewings that user logged in  Android application, there are some biases. In particular:
 - Users are movie lovers, that may consume more movies than the average person
 - The application is relatively new, so not all old viewings may be logged inside the application
 - Users are mainly italian or from the U.S.A. This favours movies from those countries.
  
 Those biases create some pattern in the data that may skew the clustering results. In particular, some features that are not intrinsic to the movie may dominate the classification strategy. Those features are:
 - Being a recent movie with a theatrical release
 - Being a very popular movie
 - Being a "classic"
 
 Those biases are so strong that are clearly visible from the similarity matrix. For example, this image represents the pairwise similarities among the 200 most popular movies (the brighter the pixel, the higher the similarity).

 As expected, basically all pairs have a high similarity, since the most popular movies have been watched by basically all users.
 
## Dominant sets clustering
For the purpose of this project, the simpler version of dominant set clustering was used: the discrete replicator dynamics algorithm was used in combination to the peel off strategy.  
The peeling was repeated until all data was clustered. This created a partition among all movies.

One of the advantages of Dominant sets clustering is that there are not much hyper parameters. Nonetheless, a big factor for obtaining good results is to use a good criterion to stop the iteration of the replicator dynamic. Since the payoff matrix is symmetric, theory ensures that each iteration step will improve the clustering result. This fact, along with some testing, created the following stop condition. The iteration continue when it satisfies at least one of those criteria:
- I'm in the first 5000 iterations, and the distance is bigger than `10 ^ -6` (the distance refers to how much the population share moved in one iteration)
- I'm in the first 50000 iterations, and the cluster still contains more than half of the dataset
- In the last 25 iterations at least an element has been removed from the cluster.

Another parameter to choose is the minimum value in order to consider an element as a member of the cluster. After some experiments, choosing `10 ^ -100` seems a good choice. This makes sense, given the game theory interpretation of that number. 

## Spectral clustering
Unlike Dominant set, spectral clustering requires the number of clusters as a parameter. Given the results obtained from the dominant set clustering, I choose the number to be 100.

## Results
Before diving into the differences in the actual results, the two clustering algorithm have some intrinsic differences:
- Like already mentioned, the number of clusters for dominant set comes directly from the data
- Dominant set extract clusters in the order of how "prominent" the cluster is.
- Elements inside dominant set's clusters have an intrinsic metric proportional to how much they belong to the cluster. 

These are nice property that makes dominant sets more suitable for clustering movies. Especially the first two properties allows excluding movies that don't belong to any clear cluster.

### Human evaluation
Before looking at more measurable metrics to determine quality of the clusters, I observed the results of both algorithms. 

For both clustering algorithms:
- Excluding the USA, movies that are from a specific nation are clustered tighter, regardless of the actual properties of movie. This includes for example italian or indian films. 

For Spectral clustering:
- Some movie collections are perfectly clustered, for example the 007 saga, Pok√©mon movies, Dragonball, Scooby-Doo
- Some very similar movie collections are clustered togheter. For example, all the Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, Nightmare, Chucky, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Child's Play are clustered togheter. These are all horror sagas.
- Only 26 out of 100 clusters contained movies that I considered very similar
- 45 out of the 100 clusters didn't exhibit any clear pattern about their content 

For Dominant sets clustering:
- The first cluster contains very popular movies, that have not much in common.
- Differently from spectral clustering, out of 24 clusters, 12 of them exhibit a clear pattern. 
- 12 out of 24 clusters contained movies that I considered very similar
- Only 9 out of 24 clusters didn't exhibit any clear pattern about their content

It's obvious that some of those observations are very subjective, but nonetheless they portray a clear picture: dominant set seems to produce better overall results.
